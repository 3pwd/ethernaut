## <a name='Delegation'></a>Level 6 - Delegation
**Target: claim ownership of the [contract](./contracts/level/Delgation.sol).**
### Weakness
The `Delegation` fallback implements a `delegatecall`.
By sending the right `msg.data` we can trigger the function `pwn()` of the Delegate contract.
Since this function is executed by a `delegatecall` the context will be preserved:
`owner = msg.sender = address of contract that send data to the Delegation fallback (attacker contract)`
### Solidity Concepts: storage, call another contract's function
There are several ways to interact with other contracts from within a given contract.
#### If ABI available
If the [ABI](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/abi-spec.html)
(like an API for smart contract) and the contract's address are known,
we can simply instantiate (e.g with a contract interface) the contract and call its functions).
```
contract Called {
	 function fun() public returns (bool);
}

contract Caller {
	 Called public called;
	 constructor (Called addr) public {
		 called = addr;
	}

	function call () {
	  called.fun();
	}
}
```
#### ABI not available: `delegatecall` or `call`
*Calling* a function means injecting a specific context (*arguments*) to a
group of commands (*function*) and commands are executing one by one with this context.
##### Bytecode
In Ethereum, a function call can be expressed by a 2 parts bytecode as long as 4 + 32 * N bytes.
- Function Selector: first 4 bytes of function call’s bytecode.
Generated by hashing target function’s name plus with the type of its arguments
excluding empty space. Ethereum uses keccak-256 hashing function to create function selector:
`functionSelectorHash = web3.utils.keccak256('func()')`
- Function Argument: convert each value of arguments into a hex string padded to 32bytes.

If there is more than one argument, they are concatenated.
In Solidity encoding the function selector together with the arguments can be done with `abi.encode`, `abi.encodePacked`, `abi.encodeWithSelector` and abi.encodeWithSignature:
`abi.encodeWithSignature("add(uint256,uint256)", valueForArg1, valueForArg2)`
##### Call: doesn't preserve context.
Can be used to invoke public functions by sending `data` in a transaction.
`contractInstance.call(bytes4(keccak256("functionName(inputType)"))`

##### [DelegateCall](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.6.2/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html#delegatecall-callcode-and-libraries): preserves context
`contractInstance.delegatecall(bytes4(keccak256("functionName(inputType)"))`  
Delegate calls preserve current calling contract's context (storage, msg.sender, msg.value).
The calling contract using delegate calls allows the called contract to mutate its state.

### Hack
1. Compute the encoded hash that will be used for `msg.data`
2. Send `msg.data` in a transaction to the contract fallback

### Takeaways
- Use the higher level call() function to inherit from libraries, especially when you don’t need to change contract storage and do not care about gas control.
- When inheriting from a library intending to alter your contract’s storage, make sure to line up your storage slots with the library’s storage slots to avoid unexpected state changes..
- Authenticate and do conditional checks on functions that invoke delegatecalls.

## <a name='Force'></a>Level 7 - Force
**Target: make the balance of the [contract](./contracts/levels/Force.sol) greater than zero.**
### Solidity Concept: [selfdestruct](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.6.2/units-and-global-variables.html#contract-related)
3 methods exist to receive Ethers:
1.  Message calls and payable functions
	- `addr.call{value: x}('')`: returns success condition and return data, forwards all available gas, adjustable
	- `<address payable>.transfer(uint256 amount)`: reverts on failure, forwards 2300 gas stipend, not adjustable
	- `<address payable>.send(uint256 amount) returns (bool)`: returns false on failure, forwards 2300 gas stipend, not adjustable
```
function receive() payable external {}
```
2. contract designated as recipient for mining rewards
3. `selfdestruct(address payable recipient)`: destroy the current contract, sending its funds to the given Address and end execution.

### Hack
As the contract to hack has no payable function to receive ether, we send ether to it by selfdestructing another contract, designating the victim contract as the recipient.
### Takeaways
By selfdestructing a contract, it is possible to send ether to another contract even if it doesn't have any payable functions.
This is dangerous as it can result in losing ether: sending ETH to a contract without withdraw function, or to a removed contract.

## <a name='Vault'></a>Level 8 - Vault
**Target: Unlock Vault [contract](./contracts/levels/Vault.sol).**
### Weakness
The `unlock` function relies on a password with a `private` visibility.
There is no real privacy on Ethereum which is public blockchain.
The `private` visibility parameter is misleading as all data can still be read.
Indeed the contract is available, so an attacker can know in which storage slot a variable is stored in and access its value manually using `getStorageAt`.
### Solidity Concepts: storage
#### [Storage: storage vs memory](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.6.2/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html#storage-memory-and-the-stack)
- storage: persistent data between function calls and transactions.
	- Key-value store that maps 256-bit words to 256-bit words.
	- Not possible to enumerate storage from within a contract
	- Costly to read, and even more to initialise and modify storage. Because of this cost, you should minimize what you store in persistent storage to what the contract needs to run. Store data like derived calculations, caching, and aggregates outside of the contract.
	- A contract can neither read nor write to any storage apart from its own.
- memory ~ RAM: not persistent.  A contract obtains a freshly cleared instance of memory for each message call

#### [Layout](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.6.2/miscellaneous.html#layout-of-state-variables-in-storage)
Data stored is storage in laid out in slots according to these rules:
- Each slot allows 32 bytes = 256 bits
- Slots start at index 0
- Variables are indexed in the order they’re defined in contract
```
contract Sample {
    uint256 first;  // slot 0
    uint256 second; // slot 1
}
```
- Bytes are being used starting from the right of the slot
- If a variable takes under < 256 bits to represent, leftover space will be shared with following variables if they fit in this same slot.
- If a variable does not fit the remaining part of a storage slot, it is moved to the next storage slot.
- Structs and arrays (non elementary types) always start a new slot and occupy whole slots (but items inside a struct or array are packed tightly according to these rules).
- Constants don’t use this type of storage. (They don't occupy storage slots)

![Storage layout image](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1*wY8Si-mt_QZWqg0jnEDw8A.jpeg)

#### Read storage: [web3.eth.getStorageAt](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.6/web3-eth.html#getstorageat)
Knowing a contract's address and the storage slot position a variable is stored in, it is possible to read its value value using the `getStorageAt` function of web3.js.
## Hack
1. Read contract to find out in slot `password` is stored in:
	- `locked` bool takes 1 bit of the first slot index 0
	- `password` is 32 bytes long. It can fit on the first slot so it goes on next slot at index 1
2. Read storage at index 1
3. Pass this value to the unlock function

## Takeaways
- [Nothing is private in the EVM]()https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.6.2/security-considerations.html#private-information-and-randomness: addresses, timestamps, state changes and storage are publicly [visible](https://etherscan.io/).
- Even if a contract set a storage variable as `private`, it is possible to read its value with `getStorageAt`
- When necessary to store sensitive value onchain, hash it first (e.g with sha256)

## <a name='King'></a>Level 9 - King
**Target: Prevent losing kingship when submitting your [contract](./contracts/levels/King.sol) instance.**
### Weakness
The contract uses `transfer` instead of a withdraw pattern to send Ether.
### Solidity Concepts: [sending and receiving Eth](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.6.2/security-considerations.html#sending-and-receiving-ether)
- Neither contracts nor “external accounts” are currently able to prevent that someone sends them Ether. Contracts can react on and reject a regular transfer
- If a contract receives Ether (without a function being called), either the receive Ether or the fallback function is executed. **If it does not have a receive nor a fallback function, the Ether will be rejected (by throwing an exception).**

### Hack
Upon submission, the level contract sends an Ether amount higher than `prize` to the contract instance contract fallback to reclaim kingship. The fallback uses `transfer` to send the prize value to the current king which about to be replace. Only then the king address is updated. If the current king is a contract without a fallback or receive function execution will fail before the king address can be updated.
1. Deploy a malicious contract without neither a payable fallback nor a payable receive function
2. Let this malicious contract become king by sending Ether to the vKing contract
3. Submit instance

### Takeaways
- Assume any externall account or contract you don't know/own is potentially malicious
- Never assume transactions to external contracts will be successful
- Handle failed transactions on the client side in the event you do depend on transaction success to execute other core logic.

Especially when transferring ETH:
- Avoid using `send()` or `transfer()`. If using `send()` check returned value
- Prefer a ['withdraw' pattern](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.6.2/common-patterns.html#withdrawal-from-contracts) to send ETH
