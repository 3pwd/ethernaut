# The Ethernaut
*The Ethernaut is a Web3/Solidity based wargame inspired from [overthewire.org](https://overthewire.org/wargames/), played in the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Each level is a smart contract that needs to be 'hacked'.*

Solutions progressively moved to [wiki](https://github.com/r1oga/ethernaut/wiki).

[Level 19: Denial](#Denial)  
[Level 20: Alien Codex](#AlienCodex)  
[Level 21: Shop](#Shop)  

## Requirements
- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation)

## Getting started
1. Clone repository
   ```commandline
    git clone -b forge --single-branch git@github.com:r1oga/ethernaut.git
   ```
2. Run test LevelName:
   ```commandline
   forge test --mc LevelName
   ```

## <a name='Denial'></a>Level 19 - Denial
**Target**
> This is a simple wallet that drips funds over time. You can withdraw the funds slowly by becoming a withdrawing partner.
If you can deny the owner from withdrawing funds when they call withdraw() (whilst the [contract](./lib/levels/Denial.sol) still has funds) you will win this level.

### Weakness
The `withdraw` function uses `call` to send ETH to an unknown address. This poses two threats:
1. Reentrancy (see [Level 10 - Reentrancy](#Reentrancy): the recipient can implement a malicious fallback that will call back ('reenter') the `withdraw` function
2. Out Of Gas (OOG) error: `call` forwards all gas. The recipient may consume it all to prevent the execution of the following instructions.
### Solidity Concepts: [error handling]()

|expression|syntax|effect|OPCODE||
|--|--|--|--|--|
|throw|`if (condition) { throw; }`|reverts all state changes and deplete gas|version<0.4.1: INVALID OPCODE  - 0xfe, after:  REVERT- 0xfd|deprecated in version 0.4.13 and removed in version 0.5.0
|assert|`assert(condition);`|reverts all state changes and depletes all gas|INVALID OPCODE - 0xfe
|revert|`if (condition) { revert(value) }`|reverts all state changes, allows returning a value, refunds remaining gas to caller|REVERT - 0xfd
|require|`require(condition, "comment")`|reverts all state changes, allows returning a value, refunds remaining gas to calle|REVERT - 0xfd

So the main difference is that `assert` depletes all gas while `revert` and `require` don't. `require` is a less verbose version of `revert`.
When to use which error handling method? According to the [solidity documentation](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/control-structures.html#id4)
> The assert function should only be used to test for internal errors, and to check invariants. Properly functioning code should never reach a failing assert statement; if this happens there is a bug in your contract which you should fix.
> The require function should be used to ensure valid conditions that cannot be detected until execution time. This includes conditions on inputs or return values from calls to external contracts.

### Hack
We want to make the `owner.transfer(amountToSend);` instruction fail right after the `partner.call.value(amountToSend)("");` instruction. As `call` forwards all gas, we will cause an Out Of Gas error.
1. Deploy a malicious contract and set it as withdraw partner with `setWithdrawPartner`
2. Cause an Out Of Gas Error by implementing a malicious fallback (that receive the ETH sent by the `partner.call.value(amountToSend)("")` instruction)
	- Option 1: reenter in `denial.withdraw()`
	- Option 2: `assert` a false condition

### Takeaways
See [Level 10 - Reentrancy](#Reentrancy) takeaways.
## <a name='AlienCodex'></a>Level 20 - Alien Codex
**Target: claim ownership of the [contract](./lib/levels/AlienCodex.sol)**
### Weakness
`codex` is stored as a dynamic array. `retract()` reduces `codex` length without checking against underflow. So it is actually possible to set the `codex` array length to 2¬≤‚Åµ‚Å∂ -1, which gives power to modify all storage slots.
### Solidity Concepts: [storage layout](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.6.6/miscellaneous.html#mappings-and-dynamic-arrays) of dynamically sized variables
Each smart contract running on the Ethereum Virtual Machine maintains its own state using a key:value storage mapping. The number possible of keys is so **huge** that most keys actually contain empty values.  Each key is called a slot. They are  2¬≤‚Åµ‚Å∂ - 1 slots. Each slot can contain 32 bytes of data.  
In the [Level 8 -Vault](#Vaultt), I listed the basic storage layout [rules](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.6.2/miscellaneous.html#layout-of-state-variables-in-storage). Each statically sized variable gets a reserved slot which is defined at compilation time.  
But what about dynamically sized variables? As their size is not fixed beforehand, how to know which slots to reserve?  
With regular hard drive space or RAM an *allocation* step to find free space to use exists, which is followed by a *release* step to put that space back into the pool of available storage. The number of storage locations of a smart contract is so huge that it manages its storage differently. It just needs to figure a way to define a storage location to start from. Indeed the likelihood of having location clashes is (not rigorously) 0.
> Due to their unpredictable size, mapping and dynamically-sized array types use a Keccak-256 hash computation to find the starting position of the value or the array data. These starting positions are always full stack slots.
> For dynamic arrays, [the] slot stores the number of elements in the array (byte arrays and strings are an exception, see below). For mappings, the slot is unused (but it is needed so that two equal mappings after each other will use a different hash distribution). Array data is located at keccak256(p) and the value corresponding to a mapping key k is located at keccak256(k . p) where . is concatenation.

## Hack
0. Analyze storage layout

  |Slot #|Variable|
  |--|--|
  |0|contact bool (1 bytes) & owner address (20 bytes), both fit on one slot|
  |1|codex.length|
  |keccak256(1)|codex[0]|
  |keccak256(1) + 1|codex[1]|
  |...||
  |2¬≤‚Åµ‚Å∂ - 1|codex[2¬≤‚Åµ‚Å∂ - 1 - uint(keccak256(1))]|
  |||
  |0|codex[2¬≤‚Åµ‚Å∂ - 1 - uint(keccak256(1)) + 1] --> can write slot 0!|

1. call `make_contact` to be able to pass the `contacted` modifer
3. call `retract`: this provokes and underflow which leads to `code.length = 2^256 - 1`
4.  Compute codex `index` corresponding to slot 0: `2¬≤‚Åµ‚Å∂ - 1 - uint(keccak256(1)) + 1 = 2¬≤‚Åµ‚Å∂ - uint(keccak256(1))`
5.  Call `reverse` passing it `index` and your address left padded with 0 to total 32 bytes as `content`

## Takeaways
Modifying a dynamic array length without checking for over/underflow is very dangerous as it can expand the array's bounds to the entire storage area of 2^256 - 1. This can possibly enable modifying the whole contract storage.

## <a name='Shop'></a>Level 21 - Shop
**Target: get the item from the [shop](./lib/levels/Shop.sol) for less than the price asked.**
### Weakness
Like for the [Level 11 - Elevator](#Elevator), `Shop` never implements the `price()` function from the `Buyer` interface. An attacker can create a contract that implements its own version of this function.

### Solidity Concepts
- [Interfaces](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.6.2/contracts.html#interfaces)
- [Inheritance](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.6.2/contracts.html#inheritance)
- [External function call with `gas()` option](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.15/control-structures.html#external-function-calls)
> When calling functions of other contracts, you can specify the amount of Wei or gas sent with the call with the special options .value() and .gas(), respectively.

- Gas cost to modify storage
![Ethereum Yellow Paper screenshot - Fee Schedule](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/r1oga/ethernaut/master/img/feeSchedule.png)

#### Hack
`buy()` is calling `price()` twice:
1. In the conditional check: the price returned must be higher than 100 to pass
2. To update the price: here is the opportunity to return a value lower than 100.

So we need to implement a malicious `price` function that:
- returns a value higher than 100 on its first call
- returns a value lower than 100 on its second call
- costs less than 3000 gas to execute. So we can't write in storate. We will read `isSold` instead to perform a conditinal check: `isSold() ? 1: 101`

### Security Takeaways
- Don't let interface function unimplemented.
- It is unsafe to approve some action by double calling even the same view function.

I couldn't solve a couple of levels myself so I cheated a bit üòÖ  (especially for the [Vault](#Vault) and [Gatekeeper One](#GatekeeperOne) levels).
Her walkthroughs are great teaching material on Solidity.
I also reused some of the diagram images from her posts.
